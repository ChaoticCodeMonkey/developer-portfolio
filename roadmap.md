# Development Roadmap

## Phase 0 – Core Programming Foundations
Primary: Python

Reinforcement: Java

- Variables and data types
- Lists / arrays and dictionaries / maps
- Functions and methods
- Classes and object-oriented fundamentals
- Constructors / initialization
- Exception handling
- Basic file I/O

Goal: Strengthen mental models across both languages.

---

## Phase 1 – Backend Fundamentals (Python Primary)
- Build simple REST API (FastAPI)
- Implement CRUD operations
- Add SQLite database
- Clean project structure
- Basic input validation

Java Reinforcement:
- Rebuild small CLI programs
- Practice collections (ArrayList, HashMap)
- Structured try/catch usage
- Package organization basics

---

## Phase 2 – Containerization & Environment
- Dockerize backend project
- Environment configuration
- Logging basics
- Run services on homelab

Java Reinforcement:
- Small object-oriented project
- Practice constructors and class design

---

## Phase 3 – Expanded Systems
- Authentication basics
- API testing
- Error handling refinement
- Refactor for cleaner structure

Java Option:
- Simple backend service or Spring intro (if comfortable)
